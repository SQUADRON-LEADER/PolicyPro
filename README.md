## 📦 Dataset

* **insurance.csv** – Contains insurance-related attributes such as:

  * Age
  * Gender
  * BMI
  * Number of children
  * Smoker status
  * Region
  * Insurance charges

This dataset is commonly used for insurance cost prediction problems.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SQUADRON-LEADER/PolicyPro.git
cd PolicyPro
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn streamlit
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Application

If using Streamlit:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Or run as a normal Python script:

```bash
python app.py
```

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow

1. Load and understand the dataset
2. Perform data preprocessing & encoding
3. Train a regression model (e.g., Linear Regression)
4. Evaluate model performance
5. Use the trained model for insurance cost prediction

---

## 📈 Example Use Case

* Predict insurance charges for a user based on age, BMI, smoking status, etc.
* Compare how lifestyle factors affect insurance costs
* Learn practical regression modeling

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* 🤖 Advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
* 📊 Better visualizations & dashboards
* 🌐 Web-based UI
* 📁 Model saving & loading
* 🔐 Input validation & error handling
